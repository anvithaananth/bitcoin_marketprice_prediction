# bitcoin_marketprice_prediction
This project was done as part of my course work for Applied Machine Learning with Python course that I took in UT Dallas. The goal was to build a predictive build that could predict the market price of bitcoins on the first week of February 2018. Data visualization, data cleaning, feature selection and implementation of various regression models was performed. Given that the nature and speculation surrounding bitcoin makes it harder to accurately predict the market price, we were required to select one that was most accurate among all the models that was implemented. The various regression models that were implemented are 1) Linear Regression 2) KNN Regression 3) Polynomial Regression 4) Ridge Regression 5) Lasso Regression 6) SVM without kernels and 7) SVM with kernels. The accuracy of all these models were compared, and KNN regression was the most accurate among the lot.
